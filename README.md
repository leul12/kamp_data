 This data set contains PM `(particulate matter)`, `temperature`, and `humidity` readings taken with low-cost sensors. These sensors measure the concentration of `PM` in the air, including particles with diameters less than or equal to 1 micrometer (PM1), 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), and particles with diameters less than or equal to 10 micrometers (PM10). The data set includes information on the `sensor type`, `date`, `time`, and `location` of the readings, as well as the sensorâ€™s specific measurement `values` for Temperature `(C)`, Humidity `(%)`, `PM1`, `PM2.5`, and `PM10`. 

**Note that P0 in the data represents PM1, P2 represents PM2.5, and P1 represents PM10**
